% Optimization problems seek the maximization or minimization of a scalar objective function on a domain which is in general multidimensional. NP-Hard optimization problems are those for which the objective function may be easy to evaluate at a point, but the number of points which could be optimal is either impossible or highly unlikely to be \apriori reducible to

NP-Hard optimization problems with NP-Complete decision problem analogs are characterized by an objective function which is easy to evaluate at a point but a ``search space'' of feasible solutions which is exponentially large in the size of the problem. Local search is a strategy which attempts to find a good solution quickly by iteratively evaluating feasible solutions which are in some heuristic sense similar to the present solution -- in its ``neighbourhood'' -- and choosing solutions which are an improvement on the present. An ideal local search algorithm thereby works toward optimality while evaluating only an exponentially smaller subset of the search space---but inevitably will converge to a a point which is only optimal with respect to its immediate neighbours. Our Heuristic and Approximation algorithms apply different local search strategies to the \minWSCP, and in our tests find results fairly close to the global minimum, but very rarely attain it.

Metaheuristics are algorithms which augment local search with global information, progressively divining the structure of the search space from local search results and guiding the local searches towards the optimal. In order to improve on the performance of our algorithms, we guide the local search with an annealing metaheuristic; that is, one which allows selection of inferior neighbouring solutions prescribed according to a ``computational temperature'' parameter whose magnitude corresponds to a ``smoothing'' of the neighbourhood structure which the local search algorithm imposes on the search space. Of the varieties of annealing metaheuristics, we choose~\cite{Kirkpatrick671} Simulated Annealing (SA), which was the first annealing method used in optimization and has remained the most popular.
