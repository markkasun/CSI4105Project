  abstract={Magnetic freeze-out of conduction electrons into donor levels is studied at low temperatures using two InSb samples containing excess donor density N D -N A =7.5*10 13 cm -3 in magnetic fields between 1 and 18.5 T. Detailed analysis of experimental data gives a number of donors N D in the sample and an ionisation energy to the ground magnetodonor state as a function of magnetic field. The ionisation energies determined are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical ones, calculated with the use of a variational procedure and a three-level nonparabolic model for InSb. Possible reasons for the observed small discrepancy between the experimental and the theoretical ionisation energies are discussed.}

  abstract={The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R H , and conductivity sigma of n-InSb in the range 77-300K has been determined using the Van der Pauw technique. The experimental values of the Hall mobility are analysed in the relaxation time approximation for both the parabolic and non-parabolic cases, considering electron scattering by ionized impurities, polar optical phonons and acoustic deformation potential. The influence of electron-electron scattering on polar optical and ionized impurities has also been studied.}
